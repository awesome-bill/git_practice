Hello Git and GitHub

The purpose of the project is to learn how use Git and GitHub to work on a HTML/CSS project. 
Other projects will follow in order to work on building some sort of portfolio. 

Testing to see how this is going to work 

Seems to be working well so far, just need to keep making changes in order to keep progressing
Progress not perfection
